# Extending Selene

More information about extending Selene will be added soon!

The main modules that users may want to extend are

- `selene_sdk.samplers.OnlineSampler`
- `selene_sdk.sequences.Sequence`
- `selene_sdk.targets.Target`

Please refer to documentation for these base classes for the time being.

If you are interested in contributing new modules to Selene or requesting new functionality, please submit an issue to [Selene](https://github.com/FunctionLab/selene/issues) or send an e-mail to <kchen@flatironinstitute.org>.
