# Extending Selene

More information about extending Selene will be added soon!

The main modules that users may want to extend are `selene.samplers.OnlineSampler`, `selene.sequences.Sequence`, and `selene.targets.Target`.
Please refer to documentation for these base classes for now.

If you are interested in contributing new modules to Selene or requesting new functionality, please submit an issue to [Selene](https://github.com/FunctionLab/selene/issues) or send an e-mail to <kchen@flatironinstitute.org>.
